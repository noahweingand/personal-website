The source code for my personal website. No live version currently since it is still under construction. To view currently, pull the source code and open the HTML in any web browser. My main goal was to keep it super simple as this is just a path to route to my professional sites.

# Technologies
Created with HTML and CSS. I use JavaScript for some visual art using the p5.js library.

# Plans
