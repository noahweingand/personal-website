# noahweingand
The source code for my personal website. There is no live version available as I'm figuring out how I want to deploy it. To view currently, pull the source code and open the HTML in any web browser. My main goal was to keep it super simple as this is just a path to route to my professional sites.

# Technologies
Created with HTML and CSS. I use JavaScript for some visual art using the p5.js library.

# Plans
-   Make responsive (html and css)
-   Figure out how to format JS art better (possibly in background?)
-   Deploy
